# Java-Bank

Trying to create a system that represents a bank where you could create an account and a account for investing. 

Creating an account == kayttotili, regular bank account for depositting and spending.

Creating an investment account == sijoitustili, account for buying/selling stocks requires regular bank account before creating the investment account.


Ran into troubles in late November so the project has been sitting quite a long time at this state where it's not working the way I wanted :D. I'm going to come back for this project when I have more time.
